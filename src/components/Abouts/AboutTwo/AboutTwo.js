                            Saving a life is a very noble cause. By giving our youth the knowledge, confidence and desire to come to the aid of others in traumatic situations before medical help arrives, many a life can be saved. Trauma Care – Kozhikode (‘TRACK’) was incepted with the main objective of rendering life saving assistance to accident victims and speedy transport to a medical center from the accident site. It is an independent, non-profit organization, functioning above political, communal and economic interest.
